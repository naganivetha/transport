	number of the valence electrons Z t , such that M t = Z t − 24
	for the full-Heusler and M t = Z t − 18 for the half-Heusler alloys,

	materials with 1:1:1 (often called Half-Heusler) or 2:1:1 composition
	comprising more than 1500 members. New properties and potential fields
	of applications emerge constantly; the prediction of topological
	insulators is the most recent example. Surprisingly, the properties
	of many Heusler compounds can easily be predicted by the valence
	electron count or within a rigid band approach. The wide range of
	the multifunctional properties of Heusler compounds is reflected
	in extraordinary magnetooptical, magnetoelectronic, and magnetocaloric
	properties. Co2-Heusler compounds are predicted and proven half-metallic
	ferromagnets showing Slater–Pauling type behavior. The recently
	discovered Mn2-Heusler compounds are another class of half metallic
	Heusler compounds which even can be designed to be compensated ferrimagnets.
	Tetragonal Heusler compounds Mn2YZ as potential materials for \{STT\}
	applications can be easily designed by positioning the Fermi energy
	at the van Hove singularity in one of the spin channels. },

	results from combining the well-known Slater–Pauling rule with
	the Kübler rule. The Kübler rule states that Mn on the Y position

	When strictly following this new rule, some candidates in the class
	of Heusler compounds are expected to be completely compensated-ferrimagnetic

	is applied to three examples within the class of Heusler compounds.
